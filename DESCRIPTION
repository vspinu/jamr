Description: Provide fast and memory efficient serialization capabilities of R
    objects based on 'cereal' C++ library. Uses simple memory layout to
    facilitate access from C++. Generates C++ ready to use header files
    for target objects in order to facilitate de-serialization from C++
    projects.
